# Biomedical Signal Analysis and Modeling
## Homework 3
1. Apply the Pan-Tompkins procedure to detect and segment each beat.
2. Label each beat as normal or PVC by visual inspection.Record the number of beats missed, if any, by your detection procedure.  
3. Compute the RR interval and the form factor FF (see 5.6.4) for each beat. 
4. Use a duration of 80 samples (400 ms) spanning the QRS - T portion of each beat to compute FF. The P wave need not be considered in the present exercise.
5. Compute the mean and standard deviation of the FF and RR values for the normal beats and the PVCs.  Evaluate the variation of the two parameters between the two categories of beats.
